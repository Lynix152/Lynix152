### Lynix-Dev

Hi, I'm Lynix, or with civil name Mathias. I am 14 years old. My interests are music and computer science. 
I play saxophone and once played accordion. In IT I am mainly interested in programming. 
However, I am also interested in artificial intelligence and server administration. 

I can program with Python, Java and C#. My current interests are C++/Rust and Flutter or Dart (the framework).
